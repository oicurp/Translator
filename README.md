# Translator
A python script that auto translate word (docx) document

Note:
1) Got to baidu Fanyi api site, to apply for developer account.
2) Create your own terminology for API will make the translation more accurate.

Development needed:
1) to skip the non-chinese paragraphs
2) docx files, when saved, will lose their formats, this needs to be fixed.
3) the header and footer are not translated, this can be fixed by expanding the script to not just paragpah and tables.
